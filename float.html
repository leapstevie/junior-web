    <p>A decade of conflict followed the death of Jayavarman V. Three kings reigned simultaneously as antagonists until
        Suryavarman I (reigned 1006–1050) gained the throne.[12]: 134–135  Suryavarman I established diplomatic
        relations with the Chola dynasty of south India.[26] Suryavarman I sent a chariot as a present to the Chola
        Emperor Rajaraja Chola I.[27] His rule was marked by repeated attempts by his opponents to overthrow him and by
        military conquests. Suryavarman was successful in taking control of the Khmer capital city of Angkor Wat.[28]

        At the same time, Angkor Wat came into conflict with the Tambralinga kingdom of the Malay peninsula.[28][29] In
        other words, there was a three-way conflict in mainland Southeast Asia. After surviving several invasions from
        his enemies, Suryavarman requested aid from the powerful Chola Emperor Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty
        against the Tambralinga kingdom.[28][30][31] After learning of Suryavarman's alliance with Rajendra Chola, the
        Tambralinga kingdom requested aid from the Srivijaya King Sangrama Vijayatungavarman.[28][29]

        This eventually led to the Chola Empire coming into conflict with the Srivijaya Empire. The war ended with a
        victory for the Chola dynasty and of the Khmer Empire, and major losses for the Srivijaya Empire and the
        Tambralinga kingdom.[28][29] This alliance also had religious nuance, since both Chola and Khmer empire were
        Hindu Shaivite, while Tambralinga and Srivijaya were Mahayana Buddhist. There is some indication that before or
        after these incidents Suryavarman I sent a gift, a chariot, to Rajendra Chola I to possibly facilitate trade or
        an alliance.[12]: 136 [32] Suryavarman I's wife was Viralakshmi, and following his death in 1050, he was
        succeeded by Udayadityavarman II, who built the Baphuon and West Baray.[12]: 135, 137–138  In 1074, conflict
        arose between Harshavarman III and the Champa King Harivarman IV.[12]: 152 </p>

    <p> THE (reigned 1181–1219) was generally considered Cambodia's greatest king. He had already been a military leader as a
        prince under the previous kings. After the Cham had conquered Angkor, he gathered an army and regained the
        capital. He ascended the throne and continued the war against the neighbouring eastern kingdom for another 22
        years, until the Khmer defeated Champa in 1203 and conquered large parts of its
        territory.[12]: 170–171 [33]: 79–80  According to Chinese sources, Jayavarman VII added Pegu to the territory of
        the Khmer Empire in 1195.[36]

        Jayavarman VII stands as the last of the great kings of Angkor, not only because of his successful war against
        the Cham, but also because he was not a tyrannical ruler in the manner of his immediate predecessors. He unified
        the empire and carried out noteworthy building projects. The new capital, now called Angkor Thom (literally:
        "Great City"), was built. In the centre, the king (himself a follower of Mahayana Buddhism) had constructed as
        the state temple the Bayon,[13]: 378–382  with towers bearing faces of the boddhisattva Avalokiteshvara, each
        several metres high, carved out of stone. Further important temples built under Jayavarman VII were Ta Prohm for
        his mother, Preah Khan for his father,[13]: 388–389  Banteay Kdei, and Neak Pean, as well as the reservoir of
        Srah Srang. An extensive network of roads was laid down connecting every town of the empire, with rest-houses
        built for travelers and a total of 102 hospitals established across his realm</p>
